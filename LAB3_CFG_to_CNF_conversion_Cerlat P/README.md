#  Context-free grammars to  Chomsky normal form 
A small code project written in Python to illustrate the conversion  context-free grammars (CFG) to  Chomsky normal form (CNF). 

To perform a conversion of a CFG to CNF follow these steps:

1) Put the json file representing the CFG you want to convert into the resources folder (my Variant is already there).

2) Run the "run.py" script located in the root directory of the project.

3) This script will prompt you which CFG you want to convert. 

4) Then the script will ask you if the steps needed to convert the CFG to CNF should be written to a text file.

5) If everything went well, you can find a json file representing your CFG converted in CNF in the output folder where my variant result are.
